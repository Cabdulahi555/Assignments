For CS211 Lab Programs:

  Must read the Lab Assignment files carefully to know what files to submit.

  All Lab related questions should go to the lab instructor.
  The lab instructor will set the deadline (strict) for all lab work.

  These files must be used to write your Lab programs!!

  When a .out demo program is available, always run it first!
  
  Always test your programs thoroughly before you are satisfied.

  Note that for week9, you will be using HW files.

FOR MOST LABS, you will need to submit the programs and recordhw results.

C++ INFO:
