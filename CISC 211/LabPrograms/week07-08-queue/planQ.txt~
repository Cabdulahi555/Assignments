  You can use queue.out to see how a queue should work and plan your
  test cases.

  Type up test cases here to test the queue class
       make sure you indicate the expected results.
  Make sure you test what happens when additions make the queue wrap around.
  Make sure you test what happens when deletions make the queue wrap around.
  Make sure you test Overflow and Underflow exceptions.
  Make sure every if-then-else is tested.
  You need to draw and plan very carefully to test all of the above.


  Note that each TASK would correspond to a menu choice.
  
     TASK                    EXPECTED RESULTS
     1. Start our program			-Should run properly

     7. Remove all elements	      		-Throw exception
     8. Remove when empty	      		-Throw exception
     9. Test isEmpty				-Should show nothing
     10. Test isempty after one el    	      	-Should show one el

     18. Press 0      	       		       	-Quit prog
continue to complete the rest of the cases

You will be graded in throughness!

Now, run queue.out with these cases and recordhw the results into week8.txt
