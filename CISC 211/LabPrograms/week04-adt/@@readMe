For Week4 Labs:

  Try student.out first to see how the student program should work.
  Try scores.out first to see how the scores program should work.

  Later,

  g++ client1.cpp student.cpp   to compile
  g++ client2.cpp scores.cpp    to compile

  Never list .h files.
  Never #include .cpp files

  Make sure you recordhw into
     week4A.txt and
     week4B.txt

  These files will be used later for another Lab.
  So, make sure you complete them!
