For Weeks 1-3:

  The goal is to become comfortable with UNIX commands.
  Make sure you can quickly compile and run programs.
  Make sure you can upload/download files from empress.

  Do not submit your work until you are "proud" of your work
    in terms of how well the program and the outputs look.

  Make sure you recordhw into
