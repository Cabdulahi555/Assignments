  You can use stack.out to see how a stack should work and plan
  the test cases.

  Type up test cases here to test the stack class
     and be sure to indicate the expected results.
  Make sure you test Overflow and Underflow exceptions.
  Make sure every if-then-else in functions is tested.

  Note that each TASK corresponds to a menu choice.
  
     TASK            	   EXPECTED RESULT
  1. check isEmpty      - should be true at the start

  2. check isFull  	- should be false at the start
  `   	   		- Test after some deletions
  			-Check in order 3,4,5,2,1


  3. add 10 elements 	- Should display in proper order, LIFO


  4. DisplayAll 	- Try when empty
     			- Test when half full
			- Test when full
			
  5. test Pop		-When empty(underflow)
     	  		- When full
			- neither


  6. test Push		- Test when empty
     	 		- Push when full (overflow)
  

continue to complete the rest...

You will be graded on thoroughness!

Now, run stack.out with these cases and recordhw the results into week6.txt
