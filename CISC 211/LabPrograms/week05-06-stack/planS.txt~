  You can use stack.out to see how a stack should work and plan
  the test cases.

  Type up test cases here to test the stack class
     and be sure to indicate the expected results.
  Make sure you test Overflow and Underflow exceptions.
  Make sure every if-then-else in functions is tested.

  Note that each TASK corresponds to a menu choice.
  
     TASK            	   EXPECTED RESULT
  1. check isEmpty      - should be true at the start
  2. check isFull  	- should be false at the start
  3. add 10 elements 	- (state what the stack looks like)
  4.
  5.
 continue to complete the rest...

You will be graded on thoroughness!

Now, run stack.out with these cases and recordhw the results into week6.txt
