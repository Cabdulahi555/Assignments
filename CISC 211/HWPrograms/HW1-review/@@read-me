For HW1:

   Make sure you read the assignment sheet first very carefully.
   
   Then, you can use hw1.out to see how the program should work.
 
   Read the entire file first to understand the structure
   and then complete the file.

   g++ hw1.cpp   to compile
   ./a.out         to run

   /cs/recordhw  test1.txt  to record into test1.txt

     compile and run

   exit to stop recording

   Download all files and submit to Canvas.
