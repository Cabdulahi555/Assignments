For HW4:

  Did you read the assignment sheet carefully?
  
  Use queue.out to see how a queue should work and plan your test cases.

  Do not change the names of variables and functions as you copy
  from my notes.

  You can copy from my Word document to emacs easily because
  right-click is Paste

  g++ queuetest.cpp queue.cpp

  Never compile the header file

 -----
  Never #include .cpp files
