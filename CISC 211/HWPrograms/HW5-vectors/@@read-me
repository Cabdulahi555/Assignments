For HW3:

  Did you read the assignment sheet carefully?

  Use stack.out to see how a stack should work and plan your test cases.

  Do not change the names of variables and functions as you copy
  from my notes.

  You can copy and paste from my Word documents to emacs easily
  because right-click is "paste".

  g++ stacktest.cpp stack.cpp

  Never compile the header file

  Never #include .cpp files

These files will also be used for HW5 so you must complete them!
