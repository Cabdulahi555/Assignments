[?2004l************** Stack Test Program *************
This demo program tests the stack ADT implemented as
an array.  
It is a menu based program allowing you to test each method. 
It displays the entire stack whenever it is modified
so that you can tell what is going on.
Use this to plan your test cases and also learn how a stack should work
