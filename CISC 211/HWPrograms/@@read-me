cs211 HW Programs
  
  All HW related questions should go to Yoshii.  Not the lab instructor.

  These files must be used to write your HW programs!!

  When a .out demo program is available, always run it first!!

  Always read the assignment sheet carefully before you begin. 
  Always re-read all the Style Notes from the notes

  Always test your programs thoroughly before you are satisfied.
  Always comment based on CS211 How to Comment.

Note that some HW programs will be used again in later HW. So,
do not skip doing HW assignments!
